## The Rolling Scopes
The Rolling Scopes is an independent international community of developers (mainly JavaScript / Front-end / iOS / Android), organized in 2013. Currently, many developers around the world know that we participate in our events and activities.

## What is RS School?
These are free Front-end, JavaScript, iOS, and Android programming courses run by The Rolling Scopes community. Everyone can study at RS School, regardless of age, professional employment and place of residence. The training involves developers from various companies and countries. In our courses we combine online and offline learning. Mentors of the school - our "iron" people - teach students in their free time and for free! Now courses are available for residents of Belarus, Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan. More information about the school on the site: https://rs.school/

## Free-of-charge learning
At RS School the principle of "Pay it forward" works. We share our knowledge with students for free now, hoping that in the future they will return to us as mentors and pass on their knowledge to the next generation of students in the same way.

## Support community
Due to the fact that The Rolling Scopes is a non-profit community of developers who, day and night, will copy their strengths and knowledge into it for free and in their free time, we started a “piggy bank” for different RS needs.
