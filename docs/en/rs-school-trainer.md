## RS School Trainer

RS School Trainers are practicing developers from different companies and countries.

## How can I become an RS School trainer?

Any RS School mentor or activist can try on the role of a coach. To begin with, it is a good practice to give an offline lecture or speak at a meetup. Development of new assignments for students of the school is a good option too, as it requires not only writing technical description of the task but also providing at least 2 webinars (task description, Q&A session and concluding remarks).

# General information for trainers

## Tasks

All theoretical lectures / materials should go along with assignments or evident application in practice.
Students usually start with the task, not a theory. And if they cannot solve the problem, they study the theory. Isolated abstract knowledge is almost not needed (except for fundamental). If students can solve a task without theory, they do not need it.

### Requirements for theoretical lectures

- No more than 2 hours of theory for each lesson. Theoretical knowledge should be covered by practice - task, test or other activity. Anything that is not practiced is quickly forgotten.
- Offline lectures should include 1-2 breaks
- Remove all unnecessary information from presentations. All the main links that can be  useful for further reading on the topic should be given at the end of the presentation
- Before giving the presentation, remove all materials / slides that are out of date. For example, nobody is interested in layout features for IE6 or handling memory leaks in IE8
- The turned on webcam during webinars makes the lecture more cordial
- During offline classes, communicate with the entire audience, and not just with students from the front rows
- It is recommended to use contrasting colors in the presentation, as all lectures are shown to the audience on the projector
- For specific and rarely used things, it is better to leave a link to the material, do not describe them in detail
- Split slides into smaller parts rather than having all information in one huge slide
- To present an API analysis of any functionality, it is better to organize workshops, not just enumerate them

### Organizing offline classes

We are constantly looking for those who want to conduct face-to-face lectures, student meetups, beerjs, office tours, etc. During face-to-face event, you can give a lecture from the RS School curriculum - https://github.com/rolling-scopes-school/lectures or just talk about working on a project, passing interviews, etc.

Venue: you can use any meeting room available for you by booking it yourself. If a list of listeners is required to access the meeting room, we will provide it.

Number of students: depends on the room.
