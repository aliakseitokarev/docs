## The Rolling Scopes

The Rolling Scopes is an independent international community of developers (mainly JavaScript / Front-end / iOS / Android), founded in 2013 in Minsk. Many developers all over the world know about us and can participate in our projects and events.

## The Rolling Scopes meetups

Our meetings are not only a communication, exchange of experience and knowledge, but also a platform where anyone can try himself as a speaker, regardless of experience and topic. We help beginning speakers with topic selection, presentation preparation, and rehearsals. Since 2013, we have organized 100+ meetups in different cities and countries. Do you want to speak at a meeting? Just email us at rolling.scopes@gmail.com
