## RS School Certificate

At students’ request, we do not issue certificates on a massive scale and set a threshold for each course.

Usually the passing score equals to 60% of the best result in the course. For example, the best student scores 1884 points, 0.60 * 1884 ~ = 1130. Thus, the passing score is 1130

### Minimum requirements for obtaining a certificate

* `CoreJS Interview` score - 4+
* Total passing score – 60% or the top score
